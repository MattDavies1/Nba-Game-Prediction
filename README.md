### Our project Objective
Our project goal is create an ELO rating system for NBA teams and build a model that predicts game scores between teams, hence predicting which team will win. An Elo rating system is a method for calculating relative skill levels of teams. It is scaled such that a significantly better team will gain less from a win than if the two teams are near evenly matched in elo. We will be using NBA team records to create the ELO system which relies on game data showing which team won the game. The model will be built using historical NBA data and the ELO system created. It will incorporate player data because certain players have higher impacts on the game than others. This will also allow us to take into account of player movements such as trades or injuries.
